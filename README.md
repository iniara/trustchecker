# TRUSTCHECKER
### Verifying the Authenticity Page File
This proposal aims to develop a document security and authentication system that utilizes the Secure Hash Algorithm-1 (SHA-1) within the context of distributed computing. The system is designed to verify the authenticity and integrity of documents by generating digital signatures using SHA-1. This project will explore distributed computing concepts to enhance the speed and efficiency of the document authentication process. With a focus on SHA-1 implementation and distributed computing, the project aims to provide a reliable and efficient solution for verifying document authenticity in distributed environments.
